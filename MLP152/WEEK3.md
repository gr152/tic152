# Week #3: Course Materials

The objective of week #3 is to get the cli working with showing menu details - foodname,quantity,price,VendorId etc.The primary objective of week #3 is to complete the Cli fully to list all Menu /Ordering the food/accept/cancel canteenmanagement applications. From this week onwards, we will be doing sprint planning and sprint review/retrospective every week.

## Java (Will be continued in Week#4 as well)

## Junit (Will be continued in Week#4 as well)

## JMockit (Will be continued in Week#4 as well)

  * We will also start doing standups from this week. https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/daily-scrum

  * Each day, as the team does the standup, one from each team notes down briefly the answers to the three questions for each team member and send it to the facilitators.

  * Here is a rough format (for each team)

    * Subject: MLP{nn} daily standup â€“ {date}

    * {team member#1}:

    * Yesterday:
      * Completed {blah}, In progress {blah}
    * Today:
      * Will complete {blah}, Will start {blah}
    * Impediments:
      * {Things like machine issues, network issues etc}
      * {team member #2:

...
* Ideally, the blahs above should include the ticket number MLP{nn}-{jj}

##  Suggested Steps

### Before starting the first task
  * Whiteboard Cli Menu
  * Whiteboard Java methods for the functionalities
  * Create skeleton class for Customer,Order,Vendor,factory classes and empty methods for order,view order history,accept/cancel, list all menu items etc.

### For the first task + story
    * One person to add Order class and factory class  
    * One Person to change cli
    * One person to add Vendor class and its factory class
    * One Person to add Customer class and its factory class 

### Similarly for the other stories

# Week #3: Workshop Day #1
  * Create Trello  Project Board for all the work to be done in Week #3 
       * A "Card" should be included to describe the below task in the Sprint Backlog 
          * Task: "Change the model/Menu java class for the columns identified"
       * A "Card" should be included to describe the below task in the Sprint Backlog
          * Task: "Change the factory/MenuFactory java class for the new attributes"
       * A "Card" should be included to describe the below task in the Sprint Backlog
          * Task: "Change the Util.CliMain java class for the new attributes"  
          * Ticket Number (manually typed) should be included as prefix in the Task                 
  * Ensure that once after creating all your task move to "To do" column in the project board
  * Move the task for "To do" to "In Progress" column and start your task  
  * Follow the process for completing the review, merging & cleanup
  * Re-run the Cli to see the changed data

# Week #2: Workshop Day #2-5

  * Complete the other tickets
  * At the end, the cli should show all the new attributes added.
    * At this point, you must be able to compile ```mvn compile``` and run the cli ```mvn exec ...```, but other command i.e., ```mvn package``` etc will fail because of lack of code coverage etc.
  * You should have added some unit tests as well.
